This file provides a more detailed breakdown of the projectâ€™s components, status, and ongoing work.

Project Overview: Crypto Trading Platform
1. Frontend
Technologies

    Electron: Provides the application shell and cross-platform capabilities.
    React: Used for building the UI components dynamically and modularly.
    Axios: For making API requests to the backend.

Components

    Dashboard: Displays live trading data and charts.
    Settings Panel: Allows users to configure trading pairs and preferences.
    Trading Signals Panel: Shows real-time trading signals generated by AI models.

Current State

    The basic UI setup is complete.
    The Dashboard component successfully fetches and displays data from the FastAPI backend.
    Next step: Integrate Plotly charts for interactive visualization.

2. Backend
Technologies

    FastAPI: A modern web framework used for building API endpoints.
    CCXT: Fetches live trading data from cryptocurrency exchanges.
    Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    Backtrader: Provides backtesting capabilities for trading strategies.

API Endpoints

    /live-data/{symbol}: Fetches live price data for a specific trading pair.
    /historical-data/{symbol}: (Planned) Retrieves historical data for backtesting.
    /trade-signal/{symbol}: (Planned) Returns AI-generated trading signals.

Current State

    The /live-data/{symbol} endpoint is operational.
    The next step is to implement the /historical-data endpoint.

3. AI and Machine Learning (Planned)
Models

    LSTM Model: For time series forecasting and market predictions.
    Regression Analysis: Basic model for identifying market trends.

Libraries

    TensorFlow: Will be used for building deep learning models.
    scikit-learn: For implementing simpler models and clustering algorithms.

4. Development Milestones
Milestone 1: Basic Trading Platform Setup (Completed)

    Frontend and backend basic setup with data fetching from the Binance API.

Milestone 2: Interactive Dashboard and Plotly Integration (Ongoing)

    Integrate Plotly charts in the frontend.
    Develop additional API endpoints for historical data.

Milestone 3: Backtesting and Strategy Implementation (Planned)

    Set up Backtrader for backtesting trading strategies.
    Implement strategies based on moving averages and other indicators.

Milestone 4: AI Integration (Planned)

    Develop and integrate an LSTM model for market predictions.
    Add a dedicated panel in the frontend to display AI-generated signals.

5. Communication Plan

    Provide updates to keep track of the development state.
    Each major feature should be documented with specific changes.
    Keep README.md and project_overview.txt updated to reflect progress and new additions.

6. Issues and Next Steps

    Chart integration needs refinement for better interactivity.
    Next step: Build and test the /historical-data endpoint in the backend.
