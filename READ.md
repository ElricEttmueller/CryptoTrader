Project Overview: Crypto Trading Platform
1. Frontend

Technologies:
Electron: Provides cross-platform support and the application shell.
React: For dynamic and modular UI components.
Axios: To handle API requests from the backend.
Key Features:
Real-time Data: Fetch and display live trading data via CCXT.
Customizable Dashboard: Built using React and Electron, providing flexibility.
AI Integration: Incorporate models for predictive trading signals.
Backtesting Engine: Test trading strategies with historical data using Backtrader.
Cross-platform Support: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Components:
Dashboard: For displaying live trading data and charts.
Settings Panel: Users can configure trading pairs and preferences.
Trading Signals Panel: Show real-time signals generated by AI models.
Current State:
Basic UI setup is completed.
The Dashboard component fetches and displays live data.
Next step: Integrating Plotly charts for interactive visualization.
2. Backend

Technologies:
FastAPI: For building API endpoints.
CCXT: For retrieving live trading data from crypto exchanges.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Backtrader: For backtesting trading strategies.
API Endpoints:
/live-data/{symbol}: Fetch live price data for a specific pair (operational).
/historical-data/{symbol}: (Planned) Retrieve historical data for backtesting.
/trade-signal/{symbol}: (Planned) Generate AI-based trading signals.
Current State:
/live-data/{symbol} is operational.
Next: Implement the /historical-data endpoint for backtesting.
3. AI and Machine Learning (Planned)

Models:
LSTM Model: For time series forecasting and market prediction.
Regression Analysis: To detect trends using simpler statistical models.
Libraries:
TensorFlow: For building deep learning models.
scikit-learn: For simpler machine learning models and clustering.
4. Development Milestones

Basic Trading Platform Setup (Completed)
Frontend and backend set up, fetching data from Binance API.
Interactive Dashboard & Plotly Integration (Ongoing)
Integrate Plotly for charts.
Add API endpoints for historical data.
Backtesting & Strategy Implementation (Planned)
Set up Backtrader for backtesting.
Implement basic strategies (moving averages, etc.).
AI Integration (Planned)
Develop LSTM models for market predictions.
Add a panel for AI signals in the frontend.
5. Communication Plan

Updates:
Each major feature or milestone should be documented.
Keep README.md and project_overview.txt updated to reflect new changes.
6. Issues and Next Steps

Issues:
Chart integration needs improvement for better interactivity.
Next Steps:
Build and test the /historical-data endpoint in the backend.
Implement strategy logic for backtesting in the next iteration.
7. Server Starting Commands

Frontend (React and Electron):
bash
Code kopieren
cd frontend
npm install    # Install dependencies
npm start      # Start the frontend
Backend (FastAPI with Uvicorn):
bash
Code kopieren
cd backend
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt   # Install Python dependencies
uvicorn main:app --reload         # Start backend server
Simultaneous Startup (Using npm-run-all):
bash
Code kopieren
npm install npm-run-all
npm start
Troubleshooting:
Ensure no other applications are using the default ports (3000 for frontend, 8000 for backend), or modify the configurations.
