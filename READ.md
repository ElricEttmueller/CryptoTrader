# Crypto Trading Platform

A highly customizable cryptocurrency trading platform built with Electron and Python. The platform supports real-time data visualization, trading signals, and backtesting functionalities. The frontend uses React and Electron for a dynamic and modern UI, while the backend uses FastAPI for trading logic, data integration, and API management.

## Features
- **Real-time Data**: Fetch and display live trading data using CCXT.
- **Customizable Dashboard**: A modular and customizable interface built with React and Electron.
- **AI Integration**: Implement predictive models using TensorFlow and scikit-learn.
- **Backtesting Engine**: Test trading strategies using historical data with Backtrader.
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend

    Install dependencies and run the development server:

    bash

    npm install
    npm start

Backend Setup

    Navigate to the backend directory:

    bash

cd backend

Create a virtual environment:

bash

python -m venv env
